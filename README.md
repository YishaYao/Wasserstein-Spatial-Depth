# Wasserstein-Spatial-Depth

This repository provides R implementation of a new notion of depth defined on Wasserstein spaces. 
There are two directories named "Simulations" and "Application", which contain the R codes for simulations and application, respectively, in the paper "Wasserstein Spatial Depth". 

## Codes for simulations

There are three aspects in simulations, including consistency, relationship between Wasserstein spatial depth and conventional spatial depth, and outlier detection. The corresponding scripts are named as "consistency.R", "Wdepth_vs_Sdepth.R", and "outlier_detection.R". 

## Codes for application

The datasets are downloaded from this public database "European Climate Assessment and Dataset" (https://www.ecad.eu/dailydata/index.php).
The codes are selfexplanable. 

# Welcome to use and modify our codes

We encourage you to use and adopt codes in this repository. Please cite our paper   upon using the code. 
Details of the method can also be found in the paper.
